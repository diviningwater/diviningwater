I am an associate professor at (Utah State University)[https://www.usu.edu/], focused in irrigation, agriculture, drones, and satellites [link](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/torres-alfonso). I am associated with the  [Utah Water Research Laboratory](https://uwrl.usu.edu/), and the [Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/). I specialize in innovative Irrigation Engineering and conducts research on irrigation water management using state-of-the-art drone and satellite technologies, which can help farmers save water, increase crop yield, and reduce environmental footprint. I hold a teaching appointment at the Agricultural Engineering Faculty at La Molina National Agrarian University, Peru, where he collaborates with faculty members. Furthermore, his research activities cover optimizing agriculture / urban irrigation, water balance, and water-use and stress using remote sensing (satellites and drones) over grassland, grapevines, almonds, cherries, olive, rice, and urban green areas in the Western US, South America, and Middle East.  <br>
